# 🌮Tacos and Flowers🌻

Welcome to my inventory app! This project is created to showcase dynamic site operations for creating, updating, reading, and deleting objects in a database. I built this project for valentines day for my girlfriend who love tacos 🌮 and for me who loves flowers 🌻. 

⚠️To prevent desctructive actions from users, there will be a password for updating and deleting objects.
